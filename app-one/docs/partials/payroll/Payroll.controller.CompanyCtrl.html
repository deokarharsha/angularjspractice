<div class="description"><div class="payroll-controller-page payroll-controller-companyctrl-page"><p>A company controller is used to store and retrieve company details.
A company controller is attached to the &#39;company.html&#39; page via the ng-controller directive, AngularJS will instantiate a new Controller object,
using the specified Controller&#39;s constructor function. A new child scope will be created and made available as an injectable parameter to the
companyCtrl constructor function as $scope.</p>
<p>The fields of company page are stored under $scope.data json object. Due to which we can send collection of json to post service.
Here in company page we had performed add &amp; edit operations using same view template. Means if $scope.data.ID = 0 then its an add mode and
if it is not then it will be work in edit mode.</p>
